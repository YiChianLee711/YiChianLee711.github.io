## Websites I Recommend
* [Notion](https://www.notion.com/): I highly recommend signing up for this website, this is a website where you can organize your courses and studies by arranging timelines, calendars, and notes. I used this website a lot to help me organize my time and studies. There are also some new features on this website where you can create a website, and there is a new Notion AI which is also quite helpful. I like that this note-taking website can embed code zone to put your programming codes in it, you can also embed other cloud services into your note (Github or GitLab is also available to embed into the note).
* [Slidesgo](https://slidesgo.com/): This is a great website where you can find many templates for beautiful and creative presentations, download the template you like, and edit it with PowerPoint or Google Slides.
* [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/): This is a useful website for exploring different tools, functions, codes, and hacks in programming. It covers many languages, including HTML/CSS, SQL, PYTHON, JAVA, C#, and so on. You can also find some frameworks like Bootstrap, React, JQeury, DJANGO, and so on. This website helped me a lot in the past when I was writing codes and developing websites.
* [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/): This website allows you to create diagrams, flowcharts, ERD, or UML. It can be connected to your local machine or other cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox, and GitLab. I find this website tool very useful in Database ERD Design, Programming Flowchart design, and System Analysis and design.
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): This website is a designing tool website, where you can create posters, slides, and other graphic design related works.
