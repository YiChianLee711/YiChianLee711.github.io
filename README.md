## Websites I Recommend
* [Notion](https://www.notion.com/): I highly recommend to sign up for this website, this is a website where you can organize your courses and studies by arranging timelines, calenders, and notes. I used this website a lot to help me orgainze my time and studies. There are also some new features on this website where you can create a website, and there is a new Notion AI which is also quite helpful. I really like that this note taking website can embed code zone to put your programming codes in it, you can also embed other cloud servies into your note (Github or GitLab is also avaliable to embed into the note).
* [Slidesgo](https://slidesgo.com/): This is a great website where you can find many templates to create beautiful and creative presentations, download the template you like, and edit with Powerpoints or Google Slides.
* [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/): This is a useful website for you to explore different tools, functions, codes, and hacks in programming. It covers many languages, including HTML/CSS, SQL, PYTHON, JAVA, C#, and so on. You can also find some frameworks like Bootstrap, React, JQeury, DJANGO, and so on. This website helped me a lot in the past when I was writing codes and developing websites.
* [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/): This is tool for you to create diagrams, flowcharts, ERD, or UML. This website can be connected to your local machine or other cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox, and GitLab. I find this website tool very useful in Database ERD Design, Programming Flowchart, and System Analysis and design.
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): This website is a designing tool website, where you can create posters, slides, and other graphic design related works.
